Title: Network-based Subtype-specific Drug Repositioning
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bin Yang
Maintainer: Bin Yang <biny12212021@163.com>
Description: It prioritizes repurposed drugs specific to certain subtypes guided by subtype-specific proteomic signatures and drug perturbations,
    which consists of three main components. First, it integrates subtype information into network module analysis. Next, it assesses the drug 
    response levels of these modules of each subtype and construct a drug response network by drug sensitivity data. Finally, it employs the 
    PRS-based drug repurposing method to sieve repurposable drugs.
